Before this plugin can be used, you need to set up the following:

* A category to create copies of courses whilst they are being reviewed ('Deploy')
** Configure the category to use at Site admin > Plugins > Blocks > Course templating
* A role 'Course reviewer' with capability 'block/mbstpl:coursetemplatereview'
** At least one user should be allocated this capability at the 'Deploy' category level (or above) - they are a course reviewer
* A role 'Local course reviewer' with the ability to access activities in a course (editing teacher may be an appropriate starting point). Make sure they have capability 'block/mbstpl:assignauthor'.
* A role 'Local course author' with the ability to access activitities in a course (editing teacher may be an appropriate starting point, but should not be able to edit course settings).)
** Configure these roles to be used at Site admin > Plugins > Blocks > Course templating
* Create some meta data questions at Site admin > Plugins > Blocks > Course templating > Manage question forms
** Include some 'checklist' questions, which will be used to give feedback from reviewers to authors.
