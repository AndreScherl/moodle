VideoEasy Filter
===============
VideoEasy is a filter that will replace links to video files with players from various video player providers.
To give real world example, the Moodle flowplayer doesn't do all file types, or make html5 look pretty. 
The video providers like video.js and sublimevideo do this, and the videoeasy filter puts them into Moodle/

Usage
===============
Define video templates at 
Site Administration / plugins / filters / videoeasy

Several are already made for you. You can edit them if you wish. 
You can make up to ten templates though only one can be active at any time.

Installation
==============
If you are uploading videoeasy, first expand the zip file and upload the videoeasy folder into:
[PATH TO MOODLE]/filters.

Then visit your Moodle server's Site Administration -> Notifications page. Moodle will guide you through the installation.
On the final page of the installation you will be able to register templates. You can choose to skip that and do it later from the videoeasy settings page if you wish.

After installing you will need to enable the videoeasy filter. You can enable the videoeasy filter when you visit:
Site Administration / plugins / filters / manage filters

Enjoy
