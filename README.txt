This admin report plugin allows Administrators to set up arbitrary 
database queries to act as ad-hoc reports. Reports can be of two types: 
either run on demand, or scheduled to run automatically. Other users 
with the right capability can go in and see a list of queries that they 
have access to. Results can be viewed on-screen or downloaded as CSV. 

See http://docs.moodle.org/20/en/Custom_SQL_queries_report for more 
information.
